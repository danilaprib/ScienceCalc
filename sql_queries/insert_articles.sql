'Arduino is a great choice for starting with electronics. Whether you want to make IoT, a robot or some other device arduino will do the job. It\'s easy to program and attach components to and a great choice for beginners.
This article will provide small tutorial on how to start with building your first project with Arduino.
First, you need to define the scope of your project: would it be a small device or something more complex and how much components you plan to use? If you are going for something simple you can go for Arduino Nano. If you need more pins to attach all your components to than Arduino Uno is a great choice.
Choose the components you need for your project. Remember to check voltage requirements for each component, since Arduino Uno, for example, comes with only 3.3V and 5V pins.
To program your board you can use Arduino IDE <-- should be a hyperlink here. It comes with built-in features like serial monitor to see the serial data that is being received by your board and you can compile and upload your code to the board.
 
That\'s it
